## 🔁 Next Steps

1. Replace placeholders:
   - URLs for frontend/backend deployment
   - Your name, email, portfolio
2. Save it as `README.md` in the root of your project (or both frontend and backend repos).
3. Push changes to GitHub.

Let me know if you'd like me to create separate READMEs for **frontend** and **backend** repos or generate badge links (like `Live Demo`, `Tech Stack`, etc.) too.
